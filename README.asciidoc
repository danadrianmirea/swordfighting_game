## Intro 

For our group project assessment, we have been tasked with developing an AI system that is capable of passing the Turing test. The system would attempt to mislead a user into believing it is interacting with another human in a given scenario. As a group we are developing the two player combat game, Swords of Turing, which pits the user against an AI.
The Turing test, theorised and developed by Alan Turing, is a test of a computer system's ability to act in such a way that it would be indistinguishable from another human. The system would take in input from a human and, using natural language processing (NLP), generate a response that would try and fool the user into thinking that it was human. The aim for this project is to develop such a system.
We have chosen a combat game as a case study for a number of reasons. After extensive discussion as a group, we had a list of skillsets that would be useful in the completion of the assessment. With confident programmers and game students, making a game was seen as a good idea. The group was confident in understanding game AI and systems, as well as being a passionate hobby amongst all members.
Another advantage for the chosen case study was the lack of emphasis on the NLP side of the Turing test. NLP is a very advanced and complex system to get right, with random input from users often garnering stock responses from simple AIs, very easy to be caught out by the Turing test. Focusing more on AI that makes mistakes in the context of a game removes the need to create a database that would be too large to develop within our given timeframe. This increases our chances of developing a system that meets the objective of the assessment.
When discussing the idea for what game to make, many ideas were put forward. Games like Scrabble and Countdown were proposed quite early on. However, an AI that generates words and solves maths problems was deemed too hard to fake. The AI couldn’t really make mistakes and would likely end up generating results that were clearly computerised. This kind of system would fail to meet the aim of the assessment and so was written off.
We then discussed more visual based games like Connect 4 and chess as viable options. Although easier to develop, Connect 4 would not really challenge the group in any way. The mechanics and dynamics of games of this nature would not serve as a complex enough base for our AI system. Chess was deemed almost the opposite, with millions of permutations for any game, the system would be far beyond the scope of the group’s skillset.
Following the decision to develop our own game we decided that designing a system with a limited number of moves would lead to fluid player interaction as well as being manageable for AI programming. Having only a limited number of moves in the game means we can develop at a pace that the group is comfortable with, reducing the risk of running over the allotted time in our project plan.

## Project Aims

We are aiming to create a game that is enjoyable when played with either a friend or versus an AI.
We look to develop an AI that behaves in a mannerism that appears to be human like, and doesn’t pertain to the traditional and inhuman traits found in most common video game AIs.
Furthering this, we will look to craft a system whereby the AI can record the player’s behaviours and devise methods by which it can counteract these actions.
Given the situation where all these aims are met, the final product should be a game where the AI is indistinguishable from another human player. This will be due to its humanised characteristics and its unpredictable, occasionally illogical, actions. It should be developed to a stage where the AI can lose intentionally in order to gain knowledge about the player, which it would then use to win.

## Project Plan and Timescales

In order to plan our timescales and that tasks that we needed to perform later on in the project. We decided to use a Gantt chart, as it specifies what task each person in the group is doing, and the timescale that they have for that task. The chart on the right shows each individual task and the category that they fall into. It clearly states the start and end date, as well as who we decided as a group, that the task is allocated to. This means that there should be no excuse for anyone being late on doing their tasks.
The chart below is a timeline of the tasks that we need to do in order to complete our project. We decided to group our tasks into four different categories; Planning, Programming and Design, Testing, and Reports and Findings. We decided to group the tasks as they help to show how well we are on track according to our plans.
